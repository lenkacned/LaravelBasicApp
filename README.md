## About my app

This application includes basic Laravel user authentication and admin's image upload functionality

The Admin dashboard page is in progress and should include: </br>
<pre>
    1. creating an image as an instance of the Image class with specific parameters </br>
    2. saving it to the database,</br>
    3. list of all images,</br>
    4. edit and delete image objects</br>
</pre>
Something about sym link does not seems to work to me (although the sym link is made) but after uploading the image it is saved in the storage directory. </br>
 >> INFO  The [public/storage] link has been connected to [storage/app/public].
